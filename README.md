# UFOs



### Overview of the analysis:

The project is to show the visitors of the website the information of UFO sightings tabulated with date, city, state, country, shape, etc..  The visitors can filter them by typing the requests into query input box.  The updated table will reflect the queries.



### Results:

- At the lower left corner, there are four text input boxes with labels of "Enter Date", "Enter City", "Enter State", "Enter Country" and "Enter Shape" for users to choose.

- For Example, we would like to choose the sighting events that happened in California.  We can type in "ca" in the box of "Enter State", as shown in the following picture with yellow color and red circle around.  The results are shown in the picture, too, with the red line highlighter.

### Summary:

The webpage looks nice.  After using it for several times, we found there is a drawback of it:

- #### Drawback:

â€‹		If the user doesn't know the options, he/she will not be able to type in the correct text to update the table.

- #### Additional recommendations for further development:

  a. to add dropdown lists for users to choose the correct text to update the table;

  b. the date format is fixed for table update, so a dropdown datepicker would be useful to maintain the correct input date format.
